    🏗️ Architecture Overview

    Core Concept

    Resource Library (Discover & Browse) + Assignment Engine (Deploy & Manage)

    Two Main User Interfaces

    1. Library View 📚

    - Purpose: Browse and discover all available Claude Code resources
    - Features: Search, filter, preview, select resources
    - Resources: Agents, Commands, Hooks, Settings profiles

    2. Assignment View 🎯

    - Purpose: Manage where resources are deployed/active
    - Features: Deploy, copy, move, activate/deactivate resources
    - Scopes: User level (global) vs Project level (specific projects)

    🚀 Expected User Workflow

    Discovery Phase

    1. Open CChorus → Resource Library tab
    2. Browse all Claude Code resources across system
    3. Search/filter to find specific resources
    4. Preview resource details and functionality

    Assignment Phase

    1. Select resources from library
