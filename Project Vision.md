🎯 Project Vision

    Transform CChorus into a comprehensive Resource Library + Assignment Engine for Claude Code 
    management, enabling users to discover, manage, and deploy Claude Code resources (agents, 
    hooks, commands, settings) across user and project scopes.

    📋 Current Status

    ✅ Backend Infrastructure Complete (100%)
    - Project scanner (CLAUDE.md discovery)
    - Agent scanner (system-wide agent discovery) 
    - Hooks scanner (settings.json parsing)
    - Commands scanner (slash command discovery)
    - Settings manager (safe configuration management)
    - Complete API endpoints for all resources

    ⚠️ Frontend Implementation Needed (0%)
    - All UI components need to be built
    - Current app only has agent management interface

    🏗️ Architecture Overview

    Core Concept

    Resource Library (Discover & Browse) + Assignment Engine (Deploy & Manage)

    Two Main User Interfaces

    1. Library View 📚

    - Purpose: Browse and discover all available Claude Code resources
    - Features: Search, filter, preview, select resources
    - Resources: Agents, Commands, Hooks, Settings profiles

    2. Assignment View 🎯

    - Purpose: Manage where resources are deployed/active
    - Features: Deploy, copy, move, activate/deactivate resources
    - Scopes: User level (global) vs Project level (specific projects)

    🗂️ Implementation Plan

    Phase 1: Core UI Infrastructure (2-3 hours)

    1. Resource Library Component
      - Unified browser for all resource types
      - Search and filtering capabilities
      - Resource preview cards
      - Bulk selection interface
    2. Assignment Manager Component
      - Scope selector (user/project)
      - Active resource dashboard
      - Assignment actions (deploy/remove)
      - Visual deployment status
    3. Navigation Integration
      - Update main App.tsx with new tabbed interface
      - Resource Library tab
      - Assignment Manager tab
      - Maintain existing Agents tab for backward compatibility

    Phase 2: Resource Management (3-4 hours)

    4. ✅ Project Manager Component [COMPLETED]
      - ✅ Project discovery and listing
      - ✅ Project detail view with active resources  
      - ✅ CLAUDE.md editor integration
    5. Hooks Manager Component 
      - Visual hook configuration interface
      - Event type and matcher management
      - Settings file integration
    6. Commands Manager Component
      - Slash command library and editor
      - YAML frontmatter editing
      - Namespace management
    7. Settings Manager Component
      - Settings file hierarchy visualization
      - JSON editor with validation
      - Backup and restore functionality

    Phase 3: Assignment Engine (2-3 hours)

    8. Resource Assignment Logic
      - Copy/move resources between scopes
      - Deployment validation and conflict detection
      - Batch operations for multiple resources
    9. Deployment Status Tracking
      - Visual indicators for resource deployment status
      - Inheritance visualization (user → project)
      - Change tracking and rollback capabilities

    Phase 4: Integration & Polish (1-2 hours)

    10. Cross-Navigation Features
      - Breadcrumb navigation
      - Quick actions and shortcuts
      - Search across all resource types
    11. User Experience Enhancements
      - Loading states and error handling
      - Responsive design improvements
      - Accessibility features

    🚀 Expected User Workflow

    Discovery Phase

    1. Open CChorus → Resource Library tab
    2. Browse all Claude Code resources across system
    3. Search/filter to find specific resources
    4. Preview resource details and functionality

    Assignment Phase

    1. Select resources from library
    2. Choose deployment scope (user/project)  
    3. Deploy resources with one-click assignment
    4. Monitor active resources in Assignment Manager

    Management Phase

    1. View deployment status across all scopes
    2. Copy/move resources between projects
    3. Experiment with different configurations
    4. Rollback or modify deployments as needed

    📊 Success Metrics

    - Discovery: Users can find any Claude Code resource in <30 seconds
    - Assignment: Deploy resource to any scope in <3 clicks
    - Management: Clear visibility into what resources are active where
    - Flexibility: Easy experimentation without breaking existing setups

    🔧 Technical Requirements

    - Frontend: React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui (existing stack)
    - Backend: Existing API endpoints (already implemented)
    - Data Flow: Resource discovery → Library display → Assignment actions → Deployment management

    📝 Deliverables

    1. Resource Library Interface - Central hub for discovering all Claude Code resources
    2. Assignment Manager Interface - Deploy and manage resource assignments
    3. Individual Resource Managers - Specialized interfaces for each resource type
    4. Unified Navigation - Seamless experience across all management interfaces
    5. Documentation - Updated README and user guides

    Total Estimated Development Time: 8-12 hours
    Result: Complete Claude Code ecosystem management platform
