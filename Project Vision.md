    🏗️ Architecture Overview

    Core Concept

    Resource Library (Discover & Browse) + Assignment Engine (Deploy & Manage)

    Two Main User Interfaces

    1. Library View 📚

    - Purpose: Browse and discover all available Claude Code resources
    - Features: Search, filter, preview, select resources
    - Resources: Agents, Commands, Hooks, Settings profiles

    2. Assignment View 🎯

    - Purpose: Manage where resources are deployed/active
    - Features: Deploy, copy, move, activate/deactivate resources
    - Scopes: User level (global) vs Project level (specific projects)

    🚀 Expected User Workflow

    Discovery Phase

    1. Open CChorus → Resource Library tab
    2. Browse all Claude Code resources across system
    3. Search/filter to find specific resources
    4. Preview resource details and functionality

    Assignment Phase

    1. Select resources from library
    2. Choose deployment scope (user/project)  
    3. Deploy resources with one-click assignment
    4. Monitor active resources in Assignment Manager

    Management Phase

    1. View deployment status across all scopes
    2. Copy/move resources between projects
    3. Experiment with different configurations
    4. Rollback or modify deployments as needed

    📊 Success Metrics

    - Discovery: Users can find any Claude Code resource in <30 seconds
    - Assignment: Deploy resource to any scope in <3 clicks
    - Management: Clear visibility into what resources are active where
    - Flexibility: Easy experimentation without breaking existing setups

    🔧 Technical Requirements

    - Frontend: React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui (existing stack)
    - Backend: Existing API endpoints (already implemented)
    - Data Flow: Resource discovery → Library display → Assignment actions → Deployment management
