# CLAUDE.md

This file provides essential guidance for Claude Code when working with CChorus.

## Quick Start Commands

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### üö® MANDATORY: Server Management
**ALL development server operations MUST use `/tmux-dev`. Direct npm commands are PROHIBITED.**

```bash
# Start servers
/tmux-dev start both frontend and backend in separate sessions

# Monitor servers  
/tmux-dev check logs from cchorus-frontend
/tmux-dev show last 50 lines from cchorus-backend

# Server management
/tmux-dev list all running sessions
/tmux-dev stop cchorus-frontend session
```

### Production & Building
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
npm start
```

## Project Architecture

**CChorus** is a React-based Claude Code resource management platform with 3-column professional interface.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 7.0.4 + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js Express API (port 3001) 
- **Data**: File system-based storage in `.claude/` directories
- **Theme**: CSS custom properties with light/dark modes

### Key Components
- **ThreeColumnLayout**: Professional 3-column interface with real resource data integration, navigation sidebar, and enhanced content editor
- **ClaudeMdEditor**: Integrated CLAUDE.md editor with react-md-editor, save/cancel workflows, and template generation
- **LayoutToggle**: Toggle between 3-column and tabbed interfaces
- **ResourceAssignmentPanel**: NEW - Cross-project resource assignment with visual tracking and copy/activate operations
- **ResourceDataService**: NEW - Unified service for loading agents, commands, hooks, and CLAUDE.md files across scopes
- **ProjectManager**: Enhanced with caching improvements and layoutMode prop for 3-column integration
- **ResourceLibrary**: System-wide resource discovery and browsing
- **AssignmentManager**: Resource deployment between user/project scopes
- **Agent Management**: Full CRUD for Claude Code agents

### Agent File Format
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: When should this agent be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional
color: "#3B82F6"           # Optional
---

System prompt content...
```

## Development Essentials

### Theme System
```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@/components/theme-provider"

const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
// Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl/Cmd + T
```

### Component Development
- Use **shadcn/ui + Radix UI** for consistent, accessible components
- Follow **muted color scheme**: `bg-muted text-muted-foreground`
- Import from `@/components/ui` for pre-built components
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### Agent Workflow Sequence
**MANDATORY**: Code Changes ‚Üí Documentation Agent (`@documentation-manager`) ‚Üí GitOps Agent (`@gitops-workflow-manager`)

```bash
# REQUIRED workflow for all changes
@documentation-manager please update documentation for [changes]
# Wait for completion, then:
@gitops-workflow-manager please commit and push changes
```

## Critical Requirements

### Task Completion Standards
**NEVER mark tasks "completed" unless ALL requirements satisfied:**

**Frontend Work**: 
- ‚úÖ Playwright testing with MCP tools
- ‚úÖ User demonstration via screenshots  
- ‚úÖ Explicit user approval

**All Work**:
- ‚úÖ Documentation agent used for doc updates
- ‚úÖ GitOps agent used for Git operations  
- ‚úÖ Agent sequence followed: Code ‚Üí Documentation ‚Üí GitOps

### Prohibited Actions
- ‚ùå Direct server commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run dev:server`)
- ‚ùå Manual documentation updates (use `@documentation-manager`)
- ‚ùå Direct Git operations (use `@gitops-workflow-manager`)
- ‚ùå Marking tasks complete without testing/approval

## Current Development

**Branch**: `feature/3-column-layout`
**Status**: 3-Column UI with Resource Integration COMPLETED ‚úÖ (August 2, 2025)
**Vision**: See [Project Vision.md](./Project%20Vision.md) for complete roadmap

### Completed Features
- ‚úÖ Professional 3-column layout with real resource data integration
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md editor integration with react-md-editor
- ‚úÖ ResourceAssignmentPanel for cross-project resource management
- ‚úÖ ResourceDataService for unified resource discovery across user/system/project scopes
- ‚úÖ Default layout experience (useNewLayout = true)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced project caching and streaming improvements
- ‚úÖ Clean project display showing descriptions vs file paths
- ‚úÖ Component architecture: ThreeColumnLayout, ClaudeMdEditor, LayoutToggle, ResourceAssignmentPanel

### Next Priority
- Enhanced resource editing capabilities for hooks, commands, and settings within 3-column layout
- Improved visual editing interfaces for individual resource types

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing with comprehensive user workflows
- Playwright testing for all frontend changes
- Theme testing (light/dark) across all components
- Responsive design validation

**Process Compliance**: Always follow agent workflow sequence, use tmux-dev for servers, get user approval before completion.
