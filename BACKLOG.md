## ðŸ“‹ Branch Creation Guide

Items marked with `[new-branch: branch-name]` trigger **automatic Git branch creation**:

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - New features and major enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes and issue resolutions  
- `docs/` - Documentation-only changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without feature changes
- `test/` - Testing improvements and additions

**Auto-Branch Creation System `[COMPLETED âœ…]`:**
- **Real-time monitoring**: `.claude/start-auto-branch-creator.sh --watch`
- **On-demand scanning**: `.claude/start-auto-branch-creator.sh --once`
- **GitOps integration**: Auto-creates GitOps agent invocations for branch management
- **BACKLOG.md updates**: Marks branches as `[BRANCH-CREATED âœ…]` when completed
- **Pre-compact analysis**: Session-end branch recommendations based on work scope
- **Priority intelligence**: High/medium/low priority branch creation timing

---

**Update Process**: This backlog is automatically maintained by the `documentation-manager` agent and synchronized with development sessions. Items move to CHANGELOG.md when completed.

**Branch Management**: Items with `[new-branch]` metadata trigger automatic branch creation via GitOps workflow.

**GitHub Integration**: Items are automatically created as GitHub Issues with appropriate labels and milestones.
