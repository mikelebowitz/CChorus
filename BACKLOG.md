## 📋 Branch Creation Guide

**Branch Metadata Workflow:**
- `[planned-branch: branch-name]` - Branch is planned but not ready for creation
- `[ready-for-branch: branch-name]` - Branch is ready to be created (triggers auto-creation)
- `[BRANCH-CREATED ✅: branch-name]` - Branch has been created successfully

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - New features and major enhancements (groups multiple related tasks)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes and issue resolutions (individual branches per bug)
- `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes requiring immediate attention
- `docs/` - Documentation-only changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without feature changes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, tooling
- `test/` - Testing improvements and additions

**Intelligent Branch Assignment:**
- Items starting with "Fix" or marked as bugs → Automatic `fix/` branches
- Feature sections with multiple items → Grouped under single `feature/` branch
- Use `[branch: existing-name]` to assign to existing branch
- Use `[planned-branch: name]` for future work planning
- Update to `[ready-for-branch: name]` when ready to begin work

**Auto-Branch Creation System `[ENHANCED ✅]`:**
- **Smart detection**: Only creates branches marked as `[ready-for-branch:]`
- **Real-time monitoring**: `.claude/start-auto-branch-creator.sh --watch`
- **On-demand scanning**: `.claude/start-auto-branch-creator.sh --once`
- **GitOps integration**: Auto-creates GitOps agent invocations for branch management
- **BACKLOG.md updates**: Marks branches as `[BRANCH-CREATED ✅]` when completed
- **Pre-compact analysis**: Session-end branch recommendations based on work scope
- **Priority intelligence**: High/medium/low priority branch creation timing

---

**Update Process**: This backlog is automatically maintained by the `documentation-manager` agent and synchronized with development sessions. Items move to CHANGELOG.md when completed.

**Branch Management**: Branches are only created when items are marked with `[ready-for-branch:]` metadata, ensuring branches exist only when work is ready to begin.

**GitHub Integration**: Items are automatically created as GitHub Issues with appropriate labels and milestones.
