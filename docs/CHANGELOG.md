**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Target Components**: HooksManager, CommandsManager, SettingsManager within 3-column layout

## Key Technical Decisions

### Component Architecture
- **Chosen**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI for accessibility and consistency
- **Rationale**: Better accessibility, TypeScript support, and maintainability
- **Impact**: Professional UI with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Theme System
- **Chosen**: CSS custom properties with class-based theming
- **Rationale**: Better performance than runtime theme switching
- **Impact**: Smooth theme transitions with no flash of unstyled content

### Build Tooling  
- **Chosen**: Vite 7.0.4 with modern plugin ecosystem
- **Rationale**: Superior development experience and build performance
- **Impact**: Sub-second hot reload and optimized production builds

### State Management
- **Chosen**: React Context + hooks for theme and toast management
- **Rationale**: Appropriate for application size and complexity
- **Impact**: Simple, maintainable state management without external dependencies

## Development Metrics (July 2025)
- **Total Sessions**: 19+ documented development sessions
- **Lines of Code**: ~5,000+ (including components, utilities, and documentation)
- **Components**: 15+ React components (10+ UI components, 5+ business logic)
- **Dependencies**: Modern, well-maintained packages with active communities
