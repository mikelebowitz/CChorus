## Commit Title
feat(ui): implement tabbed editor interface with layout improvements

## Summary
Major UI/UX refactor transitioning from 3-column to 2-column layout with a new tabbed editor interface. This update significantly improves usability, fixes theme-related bugs, and creates a more professional user experience.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Components
- **AgentTabbedEditor** (`src/components/AgentTabbedEditor.tsx`)
  - 480+ lines of new component code
  - Three-tab interface: Basic Info, Color & Tools, Prompt
  - Floating action buttons
  - Empty state handling
  - Visual error indicators

### 2. Layout Transformation
- **From**: 3-column layout (sidebar, editor config, prompt)
- **To**: 2-column layout (agent list + statistics, tabbed editor)
- Statistics moved from bottom to below agent list
- Better screen real estate utilization

### 3. Theme System Fixes
- Replaced hard-coded colors with daisyUI theme variables
- Proper CSS layering with `@layer` directives
- Theme-aware color picker with ring-based selection
- Logo theming (white on dark themes, colored on light)

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Increased logo size by 20% (h-8 to h-10)
- Renamed "Styling & Tools" to "Color & Tools"
- Fixed button positioning with floating pattern
- Removed tools list height constraints
- Added character count to prompt editor

### 5. Bug Fixes
- Fixed theme switching to properly apply to all elements
- Created `.claude/agents` directory to prevent server ENOENT errors
- Fixed color picker selection indicators
- Removed excessive `!important` CSS declarations

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive session documentation
- Added `STATUS.md` for project status tracking
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` following Keep a Changelog format
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with recent improvements
- Professional README overhaul with badges
