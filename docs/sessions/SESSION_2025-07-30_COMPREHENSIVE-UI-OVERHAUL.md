## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue #1: daisyUI Theme System Not Working
**Problem**: Only light and dark themes were loading despite configuration  
**Root Cause**: CSS compilation and import issues  
**Solution**:
- Cleared node_modules and package-lock.json for clean rebuild
- Added explicit daisyUI import: `@import 'daisyui/dist/full.css';`
- Maintained proper theme configuration in tailwind.config.js
- Implemented theme debugging and persistence

**Files Modified**:
- `tailwind.config.js` - Explicit theme list configuration
- `src/index.css` - Added daisyUI full import
- `src/App.tsx` - Enhanced theme switching logic

### Issue #2: Color Selection Visual Feedback Missing
**Problem**: Active color not showing proper selection indicator  
**Root Cause**: daisyUI base styles overriding custom selection styles  
**Solution**:
- Created dedicated CSS classes with `!important` declarations
- Implemented `.color-picker-button` and `.selected` state classes
- Used higher CSS specificity to override framework conflicts
- Applied visual feedback with white border + color ring + shadow

**Files Modified**:
- `src/index.css` - Added color picker CSS framework
- `src/components/AgentEditor.tsx` - Applied dedicated CSS classes

**CSS Implementation**:
```css
.color-picker-button.selected {
  transform: scale(1.1) !important;
  border: 3px solid white !important;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px currentColor, 0 0 0 5px white, 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.25) !important;
}
```

### Issue #3: Textarea Height Constraints
**Problem**: System prompt textarea remained bounded despite multiple attempts  
**Root Cause**: Hidden parent container constraints and grid layout limitations  
**Solution**:
- Moved textarea completely outside grid layout structure
- Created comprehensive CSS override system with `!important`
- Implemented `.natural-textarea` and `.textarea-container` classes
- Used forced height removal: `max-height: none !important`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/AgentEditor.tsx` - Restructured layout hierarchy
- `src/index.css` - Added textarea constraint removal CSS

### Issue #4: File Browser Wrong Directory Default
**Problem**: File browser defaulting to project root instead of user home  
**Root Cause**: Server configuration using `process.cwd()` instead of `os.homedir()`  
**Solution**:
- Changed server default directory to user home
- Fixed relative path display logic
- Ensured .claude folder visibility from user directory

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Updated directory defaults and path handling

### Issue #5: Logo Theme Adaptation Issues
**Problem**: CSS filters making logo dark on both light and dark themes  
**Root Cause**: Overly complex CSS filter chains causing unintended effects  
**Solution**:
- Removed all CSS filter styling from logo elements
- Returned to original blue logo for clean, consistent appearance
- Maintained professional branding across all themes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed CSS filters from all logo instances

### Issue #6: Layout and Border Cleanup
**Problem**: Unnecessary hairline borders creating visual clutter  
**Root Cause**: Default border styling throughout component hierarchy  
**Solution**:
- Systematically removed unnecessary borders from header, sidebar, footer
- Maintained essential borders for visual hierarchy
- Created cleaner, more modern interface appearance

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed border classes from layout components
- `src/components/AgentEditor.tsx` - Cleaned up form borders

## Technical Improvements Implemented

### CSS Architecture Enhancement
```css
/* Comprehensive override system */
.natural-textarea {
  height: auto !important;
  min-height: auto !important;
  max-height: none !important;
  overflow-y: auto !important;
  resize: vertical !important;
}

.color-picker-button {
  /* Complete control over selection state */
  width: 40px !important;
  height: 40px !important;
  border-radius: 50% !important;
  transition: all 0.2s ease !important;
}
```
