## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING_SECTION -->
<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: When common issues are identified during testing -->
<!-- CONTENT: Error messages, solutions, FAQ items -->

### Common Issues

**Q: Resource Library shows "Loading resources..." indefinitely**
A: 
- Verify backend server is running: `npm run dev:server` (port 3001)
- Check browser console for network errors or API failures
- Ensure you have read permissions to ~/.claude/ and project directories
- Try refreshing with the refresh button in the header

**Q: Resources appear duplicated in the library**
A: This is normal when resources exist at multiple scopes (user and project levels). Use scope filters to distinguish:
- **User scope**: Global resources in ~/.claude/
- **Project scope**: Project-specific resources in ./project/.claude/
- Check project name badges to identify source projects

**Q: Assignment operations fail**
A: Common causes and solutions:
- **Permissions**: Ensure write access to target .claude directories
- **Directory Structure**: Target projects must have .claude directory structure
- **Disk Space**: Verify sufficient disk space for resource files
- **File Conflicts**: Check for existing resources with same names
- **Path Issues**: Ensure project paths are valid and accessible

**Q: System scan finds no resources**
A:
- Verify Claude Code projects exist with CLAUDE.md files
- Check that .claude directories contain agent .md files
- Ensure proper file permissions for reading resource files
- Try manually refreshing the Resource Library

**Q: Assignment Manager shows empty project list**
A:
- Ensure projects have CLAUDE.md files (required for project detection)
- Check that project paths are within accessible directories
- Verify projects have .claude directory structure for resource storage

### Error Messages

**"Failed to load resources"**
- **Cause**: Backend API unavailable or scanning failures
- **Solutions**: 
  - Start backend server: `npm run dev:server`
  - Check console for specific API errors
  - Verify filesystem permissions for resource directories
  - Try the refresh button to retry resource loading

**"Assignment failed"**
- **Cause**: Resource deployment errors during copy/move operations
- **Solutions**:
  - Check write permissions in target directories
  - Ensure target project has .claude directory structure
  - Verify sufficient disk space for resource files
  - Review browser console for detailed error messages
  - Check for file naming conflicts in target location

**"HTTP 500" or "Internal Server Error"**
- **Cause**: Backend processing errors during API calls
- **Solutions**:
  - Check server console for detailed error logs
  - Verify resource file formats are valid (proper YAML frontmatter)
  - Ensure project paths are accessible and valid
  - Try restarting both frontend and backend servers

**"Resource not found" or "HTTP 404"**
- **Cause**: Resource files moved or deleted between discovery and access
- **Solutions**:
  - Refresh the Resource Library to update resource list
  - Check if resource files still exist at original locations
  - Verify file permissions haven't changed

**"Access denied" or "HTTP 403"**
- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions for file operations
- **Solutions**:
  - Check read/write permissions on .claude directories
  - Ensure project directories are accessible
  - Verify user has permissions for target deployment locations
