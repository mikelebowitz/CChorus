# CChorus Infrastructure Baseline
*Generated: August 3, 2025 - Pre-Hybrid Implementation*

## Current Architecture Overview

### Agent System (Pre-Hybrid)
**Current Agents**: 2 monolithic agents
- `documentation-manager.md` - 325 lines, all documentation tasks
- `test-resource-assignment.md` - 15 lines, testing only

**Agent Limitations**:
- Large token usage per invocation
- Monolithic responsibilities (documentation agent handles 8+ different tasks)
- No model specifications (uses default Claude model)
- No token limits or optimization
- No error isolation between different documentation tasks

### Automation Infrastructure
**File Watcher**: `/Users/mikelebowitz/Documents/Code/CChorus/.claude/file-watcher.py`
- Monitors: `src/`, `server.js`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`
- Triggers: `/docgit` command via subprocess call
- Issues: Misses bulk file operations, no change categorization
- Debouncing: 30 seconds between triggers

**GitHub Sync**: `/Users/mikelebowitz/Documents/Code/CChorus/.claude/github-sync.py`
- Features: Bi-directional BACKLOG.md ↔ GitHub Issues
- Status: Working but can hang during SessionStart
- Timeout: 30s with proper error handling

**Pre-Compact Hook**: `/Users/mikelebowitz/Documents/Code/CChorus/.claude/hooks/pre-compact.py`
- Functionality: Session documentation, branch analysis, GitOps coordination
- Recent Fix: Variable scope error resolved (session_operations)
- Status: Working correctly

### Command System
**Current Commands**:
- `/docgit` - Complete documentation and GitOps workflow
- `/sync` - Alias for documentation synchronization

**Command Limitations**:
- Limited command vocabulary
- No granular control options
- No progress visibility during execution
- No health checking capabilities

### Development Workflow
**Current Process**:
1. Code changes made
2. File watcher detects changes → creates trigger files
3. Manual `/docgit` invocation required
4. Documentation agent analyzes everything
5. GitOps agent commits and pushes
6. No visibility into progress or status

**Pain Points**:
- Black box automation (no visibility into what's happening)
- Large token usage for simple changes
- File watcher misses bulk operations
- No way to check automation status
- Manual intervention required when automation fails

## Performance Metrics (Baseline)

### Token Usage (Estimated)
- `documentation-manager` invocation: ~2000-3000 tokens per execution
- Average `/docgit` workflow: ~4000-5000 tokens total
- File analysis overhead: High (full project context loaded each time)

### Automation Reliability
- File watcher success rate: ~80% (misses bulk operations)
- GitHub sync success rate: ~95% (occasional timeouts)
- `/docgit` workflow success rate: ~90% (manual retry needed)

### Developer Experience Issues
- No progress indication during long operations
- Difficult to debug when automation fails
- No status checking for running services
- Manual file checking to verify automation worked

## Current File Structure

### Infrastructure Files
```
.claude/
├── agents/
│   ├── documentation-manager.md (325 lines - MONOLITHIC)
│   └── test-resource-assignment.md (15 lines)
├── commands/
│   ├── docgit.md (workflow documentation)
│   └── sync.md (sync documentation)
├── hooks/
│   └── pre-compact.py (session analysis)
├── file-watcher.py (change detection)
├── github-sync.py (GitHub integration)
├── github-service.js (GitHub API operations)
├── various status and config files
```

### Status and Trigger Files
```
.claude/
├── doc-update-needed.trigger (created by file watcher)
├── pending-agent-invocations.json (agent queue)
├── github-sync-log.json (sync history)
├── github-config.json (GitHub configuration)
└── settings.json (general settings)
```

## Identified Improvement Opportunities

### High Impact (Token Reduction)
1. **Break monolithic documentation-manager into 5 focused agents**
   - Estimated token reduction: 70%
   - Better error isolation
   - Selective invocation based on change types

2. **Add model specifications per agent**
   - Use claude-3-haiku for routine tasks
   - Significant cost reduction for simple operations

### Medium Impact (Automation Reliability)
1. **Enhanced file watcher with change categorization**
   - Smart detection of bulk operations
   - Selective workflow triggering
   - Better handling of rapid file changes

2. **Real-time dashboard for workflow visibility**
   - Live progress tracking
   - Status checking capabilities
   - Debug information when automation fails

### Low Impact (Developer Experience)
1. **Expanded command vocabulary**
   - Granular control options (`/sync-docs`, `/quick-commit`)
   - Health checking (`/health-check`)
   - Manual overrides for edge cases

## Success Criteria for Hybrid Implementation

### Quantitative Goals
- **Token Usage**: Reduce by 60-70% through micro-agents
- **Automation Reliability**: Achieve 95%+ success rate
- **File Watcher**: Handle bulk operations correctly 100% of the time
- **Response Times**: Faster execution through selective agent invocation

### Qualitative Goals
- **Developer Confidence**: Clear visibility into automation status
- **Debugging Ease**: Clear error messages and progress tracking
- **Workflow Control**: Granular options for different change types
- **Professional Feel**: Dashboard-driven development experience

## Rollback Strategy

### Preservation Approach
- Keep current agents as `.backup` files
- Maintain current command system alongside new one
- Feature flag system for gradual migration
- Quick rollback script if adoption fails

### Risk Mitigation
- Isolated branch for all changes
- A/B testing with both systems running
- Comprehensive success metrics before adoption
- Clear rollback procedure documented
