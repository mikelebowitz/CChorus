## ðŸ“š Features Overview

### Resource Library
<!-- FEATURE_RESOURCE_LIBRARY -->
<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: When ResourceLibrary.tsx is modified -->
<!-- CONTENT: Feature description, screenshots, key benefits -->

The Resource Library provides a unified view of all your Claude Code resources across your system:

- **Universal Discovery**: Find agents, hooks, commands, settings, and projects in one place
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by resource type, scope (user/project), and search queries
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple resources for batch assignment operations
- **Real-time Status**: See which resources are active and where they're deployed

**Key Benefits:**
- Discover resources you forgot you had
- Understand resource distribution across projects
- Quickly find the right resource for your needs

### Assignment Manager  
<!-- FEATURE_ASSIGNMENT_MANAGER -->
<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: When AssignmentManager.tsx is modified -->
<!-- CONTENT: Assignment workflows, scope management, deployment tracking -->

The Assignment Manager handles resource deployment and management:

- **Scope Management**: Deploy resources at user level (global) or project level (specific)
- **Copy/Move Operations**: Safely copy or move resources between scopes
- **Deployment Tracking**: Visual indicators showing where resources are active
- **Conflict Resolution**: Detect and resolve resource conflicts during deployment

**Key Benefits:**
- Experiment with configurations safely
- Standardize resources across projects
- Maintain clean separation between user and project resources

### Project Manager
<!-- FEATURE_PROJECT_MANAGER -->
<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: When ProjectManager.tsx is created/modified -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Project discovery, CLAUDE.md editing, project-specific resource management -->

*[To be implemented in feature/resource-managers branch]*

The Project Manager discovers and manages Claude Code projects:

- **Project Discovery**: Automatically find all projects with CLAUDE.md files
- **Project Overview**: See resource counts and project metadata
- **CLAUDE.md Editor**: Edit project configuration files directly
- **Resource Summary**: View all resources associated with each project

### Resource Managers
<!-- FEATURE_RESOURCE_MANAGERS -->
<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: When specialized manager components are implemented -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Hooks, Commands, Settings management interfaces -->

*[To be implemented in feature/resource-managers branch]*

Specialized interfaces for managing each resource type:

- **Hooks Manager**: Visual interface for configuring Claude Code hooks
- **Commands Manager**: Create and edit slash commands with YAML frontmatter
- **Settings Manager**: Manage settings file hierarchy and JSON configuration

5. **Preview Details**: Click any resource card to see detailed information

### Assigning Resources
<!-- WORKFLOW_ASSIGNMENT -->
<!-- SCREENSHOT: assignment-manager-deploy.png -->
<!-- STEPS: 1. Select resource, 2. Choose target scope, 3. Deploy with copy/move -->

1. **Select Resource**: From the Resource Library, click the copy icon on any resource
2. **Choose Target**: Select target scope (User Level or specific project)
3. **Deploy Resource**: Choose "Copy" to duplicate or "Move" to relocate
4. **Verify Deployment**: Check the Assignment Manager to confirm deployment status

*[To be documented when Project Manager is implemented]*

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING_SECTION -->
<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: When common issues are identified during testing -->
<!-- CONTENT: Error messages, solutions, FAQ items -->

### Common Issues

**Q: Resource Library shows "Loading resources..." indefinitely**
A: Check that the backend server is running on port 3001. Run `npm run dev:server` to start it.

**Q: Resources appear duplicated in the library**
A: This can happen if resources exist at both user and project levels. Use the scope filter to see resources by their deployment location.

**Q: Assignment operations fail**
A: Ensure you have write permissions to the target directories (.claude/agents/, .claude/commands/, etc.).

### Error Messages

**"Failed to load resources"**
- Backend server may not be running
- Check console for network errors
- Verify API endpoints are accessible

**"Assignment failed"**
- Check file permissions in target directories  
- Ensure target project exists and has .claude directory
- Review console for specific error details
