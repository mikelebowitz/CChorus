## üìã Documentation Update Process

### 1. Identify Update Scope
```markdown
<!-- Check for these markers in templates -->
<!-- STATUS_TRACKER --> - Current implementation status
<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: condition --> - When to update this section
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: description --> - Content that needs to be added
<!-- CONTENT: description --> - Existing content that may need updates
```

### 2. Extract Information from Code
When updating documentation, extract these details:

**For Components:**
- Props interface and TypeScript definitions
- Key features and functionality
- Integration points with other components
- State management patterns
- Event handlers and workflows

**For API Endpoints:**
- Request/response formats
- Query parameters and body structures
- Error conditions and status codes
- Usage examples with realistic data

**For User Workflows:**
- Step-by-step procedures
- Expected outcomes
- Error conditions and recovery
- Prerequisites and setup requirements

### 3. Update Content Strategy

**User Documentation Updates:**
- Focus on practical benefits and outcomes
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Include plenty of visual examples
- Anticipate common user questions
- Provide troubleshooting for likely issues

**Developer Documentation Updates:**
- Include technical implementation details
- Provide code examples and integration patterns
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Include debugging and troubleshooting for developers
- Update API reference immediately when endpoints change

### 4. Content Quality Standards

**Screenshots and Examples:**
- Use consistent naming: `feature-component-action.png`
- Show realistic data, not placeholder content
- Include light and dark theme versions when applicable
- Update screenshots immediately when UI changes

**Code Examples:**
- Test all code examples before adding to documentation
- Use realistic data structures and parameters
- Include error handling patterns
- Show both basic and advanced usage patterns

**Cross-References:**
- Maintain links between user and developer documentation
- Update navigation and breadcrumb references
- Ensure all internal links remain valid
- Cross-reference related features and components

## üéØ Specific Update Instructions

### When Updating Component Documentation

1. **Read the component source code**
   - Extract props interface and TypeScript types
   - Identify key features and functionality
   - Note integration points with other components
   - Document state management patterns

2. **Update template sections:**
   ```markdown
   <!-- COMPONENT_COMPONENT_NAME -->
   <!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER: When ComponentName.tsx is modified -->
   
   **Purpose**: [Brief description of component purpose]
   
   **Props Interface:**
   ```typescript
   interface ComponentNameProps {
     // Extracted props
   }
   ```
   
   **Key Features:**
   - [List key features]
   
   **Integration Points:**
   - [Document how it integrates with other components]
   ```

3. **Update user workflows** that involve the component
4. **Add/update screenshots** showing the component in action
5. **Update status markers** from [PENDING] to [COMPLETED]

### When Updating API Documentation

1. **Examine endpoint implementation** in server.js
2. **Document the endpoint:**
   ```markdown
   **HTTP_METHOD /api/endpoint/path**
   - Purpose: [What this endpoint does]
   - Parameters: [Query params, path params, body structure]
   - Returns: [Response format and data structure]
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     // Request
     fetch('/api/endpoint', {
       method: 'POST',
       body: JSON.stringify({ example: 'data' })
     })
     
     // Response
     {
       "result": "example response"
     }
     ```
   ```

3. **Update service layer documentation** if resourceLibraryService.ts changes
4. **Add troubleshooting** for common endpoint issues

### When Adding User Workflows

1. **Identify the complete user journey** from start to finish
2. **Document each step** with expected outcomes:
   ```markdown
   ### Workflow Name
   1. **Step One**: Action to take
      - Expected result: What the user should see
      - Troubleshooting: What to do if it doesn't work
   
   2. **Step Two**: Next action
      - Expected result: What should happen
   ```

3. **Include screenshots** for each major step
4. **Add troubleshooting** for common issues in the workflow

- Final proofreading and formatting

### Validation Tasks
Regularly verify:
- All internal links work correctly
- Code examples execute without errors
- Screenshots match current UI state
- Documentation structure matches actual implementation

By following these instructions, you ensure that CChorus documentation remains comprehensive, accurate, and valuable for both users and developers throughout the development process.
