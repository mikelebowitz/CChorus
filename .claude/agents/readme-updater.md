- Significant bug fixes that affect user experience

### Core Tasks
1. **Feature Status Updates**: Mark completed features with âœ…, update descriptions
2. **Installation Instructions**: Sync with actual package.json and setup requirements
3. **Quick Start Guide**: Ensure examples work with current codebase
4. **Architecture Overview**: Reflect current component structure and tech stack

### Context Documents
- Read `PRODUCT.md` for user workflows and success metrics
- Read `TECHNICAL.md` for current tech stack and constraints
- Read `STRUCTURE.md` for project organization

### Quality Standards
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Installation steps must match actual requirements
