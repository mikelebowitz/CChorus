- **Maintain main README.md** as the authoritative project overview

### 2. Update Documentation Templates
- Replace `<!-- PLACEHOLDER -->` sections with actual implementation details
- Update `<!-- STATUS_TRACKER -->` markers to reflect current state
- Respond to `<!-- UPDATE_TRIGGER -->` conditions
- Maintain consistency between templates and active documentation

### 3. Extract Technical Information
- Parse component source code for props interfaces and functionality
- Document API endpoints with request/response formats
- Identify user workflows from component interactions
- Extract architectural patterns and integration points

### 4. Maintain Documentation Quality
- Ensure all code examples are tested and functional
- Validate cross-references between user and developer documentation
- Keep screenshots current with UI changes
- Maintain consistent documentation structure and style

### Documentation Files to Maintain
- `README.md` - **Main project README** - primary entry point and project overview
- `docs/user/README.md` - Primary user guide
- `docs/developer/README.md` - Technical architecture documentation
- `docs/user/workflows/*.md` - Step-by-step user procedures
- `docs/developer/components/*.md` - Component-specific technical docs

## üîÑ Update Triggers and Actions

### Component Modifications
**When**: Any component in `src/components/` is modified
**Action**: 
1. Read the component source code
2. Extract props interface, key features, and integration points
3. Update corresponding documentation sections
4. Update user workflows that involve the component
5. Mark status as [COMPLETED] if implementation is finished

### API Endpoint Changes
**When**: `server.js` is modified with new/changed endpoints
**Action**:
1. Identify new or modified API endpoints
2. Document request/response formats with examples
3. Update API reference sections immediately
4. Add troubleshooting for common endpoint issues

### Branch Completion Triggers
**When**: Major development branches are completed
**Action**:
- `feature/resource-managers`: Update all manager component sections and main README.md
- `feature/assignment-engine`: Update deployment and assignment documentation and main README.md
- `feature/integration-polish`: Update UX and advanced features documentation and main README.md
- **All major releases**: Update main README.md with new features, installation steps, and usage examples

## üìã Documentation Update Process

### 1. Identify Changes
- Use `Grep` and `Glob` tools to find recent modifications
- Check git status and recent commits for changed files
- Look for components with new functionality or props

### 2. Extract Information
For components:
```typescript
// Extract this information:
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props and their types
}

// Key features and functionality
// Integration points with other components
// State management patterns
// Event handlers and workflows
```

For API endpoints:
```javascript
// Document:
app.get('/api/endpoint', async (req, res) => {
  // Request parameters
  // Response format
  // Error conditions
});
```

### 3. Update Documentation
- Replace placeholder sections with actual content
- Update status markers from [PENDING] to [COMPLETED]
- Add code examples and usage patterns
- Include troubleshooting for common issues

### 4. Maintain Cross-References
- Ensure user and developer documentation are consistent
- Update navigation and breadcrumb references
- Validate all internal links work correctly
- Cross-reference related features and components
- **Keep main README.md synchronized** with feature development and architecture changes

## üé® Documentation Style Guidelines

### User Documentation
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Focus on practical benefits and outcomes
- Include step-by-step procedures with expected results
- Provide troubleshooting for likely user issues
- Use consistent formatting and structure

### Developer Documentation
- Include technical implementation details
- Provide complete code examples with imports
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Include debugging and troubleshooting information
- Maintain accurate API reference with examples

### Code Examples
- Test all code examples before inclusion
- Use realistic data structures and parameters
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Show both basic and advanced usage patterns
- Include error handling where appropriate

## üîç Specific Update Instructions

5. **Review main README.md**: Ensure it accurately represents current project capabilities and installation steps

### Ongoing Responsibilities
- Monitor component changes and update documentation immediately
- Respond to API modifications with updated reference documentation
- Maintain screenshot library as UI evolves
- Validate documentation quality regularly
- **Keep main README.md current** with project evolution and new features

### Integration with Development
