  🚨 Issues & Needs Attention

  1. Bundle Size: 1.5MB production bundle needs code-splitting optimization
  2. GitHub Sync: Should be started for bi-directional BACKLOG ↔ Issues sync
  3. Backend Health: Missing /api/health endpoint for monitoring
  4. Git State: Multiple untracked files and pending changes need commit

  📈 Next Recommended Actions

  1. Start GitHub Sync: /.claude/start-github-sync.sh --sync
  2. Complete breadcrumb navigation for Column 2 navigation stack
  3. Test slide transitions and polish animations
  4. Commit current work with proper GitOps workflow
  5. Bundle optimization for production performance

  Infrastructure Health: 🟢 Excellent - All automation systems active and monitoring properly.
